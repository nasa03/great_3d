# 3D Transcriptome Map

A tool for the analysis and visualisation of correlations between 3D genome architecture, transcription and epigenetics.

## Installation

- [ ] Add a proper setup file.
- [ ] Generate a proper python package structure.

## Usage

To test the software with 100 plasmodium genes run:
```
./trans3Dmap -p test/genePositions100.tab -e test/geneExpression100.tab <outfile.html>
```
Then an html file with the plotly graphic will be generated in the current folder.


## Credits


###### Repository history.
Several students have contributed code in the initial stages of the project.

- First of all Miara Rakotomavo's M1 internship. Code into dev_Miara directory on dev_students branch.

- We have cloned-merged three repositories from 3 projet_longues student coding projects into respective directories on the dev_students branch.
