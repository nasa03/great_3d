####### Repository structure.

- We have cloned-merged the three repositories from the projet_longues student coding projects into directories on the dev_students branch.

1. Helene Kabbech [3D_transcription_map](https://github.com/kabhel/3D_transcription_map)
2. Hocine Meraouna [3D_transmap_Meraouna](https://github.com/hocinebib/3D_transmap_Meraouna)
3. Adam Belaiche [3DtranscriptionMap](https://github.com/toontun/3DTranscriptionMap)

- And also form Miara's Rakotomavo M1 internship to dev_Miara directory on dev_students branch.
